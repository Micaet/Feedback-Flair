# First Project for the Introduction to Machine Learning Course (Spring 2025)

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of correctly classifying user ratings given to ChatGPT based on the accompanying comment.

The project is divided into three stages:
1. **Data Exploration**
2. **Feature Engineering and Preliminary Modeling**
3. **Final Models, Presentation of Results, and Report**

Each stage has been validated by an independent group, and their feedback has been incorporated as improvements.
