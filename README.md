# First Project for the Introduction to Machine Learning course at the Warsaw University of Technology

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of correctly classifying user ratings (1-5) given to ChatGPT based on the accompanying comment. The F1 score has been chosen as the measure of success for our project.

## Business Objective
While ChatGPT reviews are used as a sample dataset, the model can be generalised to some
arbitrary product P. The model could be used to analyse reviews and comments left by P users in order to 
assess the sentiment regarding new updates, features, changes etc. For example, the model could be used
to identify negative comments, hence highlighting areas in need of improvement
and helping businesses enhance their products and customer satisfaction.

## Stages
The project is divided into three stages, each of which is elaborately described in the corresponding notebook:
1. **Data Preprocessing, Cleaning and Exploration (complete)**
2. **Feature Engineering and Preliminary Modeling (not yet complete)**
3. **Final Models, Presentation of Results, and Report (not yet complete)**

Each stage has been validated by an independent group, and their feedback has been incorporated as improvements.

The specific tools, libraries, and frameworks used throughout the project are documented in a separate file called requirements.txt.

## File order
To recreate our process the files should be run in the following order: 

**Stage 1**
1. **budowa_krok_1_6_preprocessing.ipynb**
2. **budowa_krok_1_6_eda.ipynb** 

**Stage 2**
1. **not yet complete**

**Stage 3**
1. **not yet complete**

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is a collection of ChatGPT user reviews and ratings. It can be found at the following link:
